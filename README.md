# wen-vscode

this is wenhoujx's vscode extension, i come from emacs where i have the freedom to write a quick `def` to customize my editor. This repo is where i do the same thing. It's a dumping ground of my customized commands.

workflows:

```sh
# run 
hit F5

# package, ignore the warnings, only local usage. 
vsce package


```
